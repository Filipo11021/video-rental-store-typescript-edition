# Modular Typescript Monolith

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a modular monolith in TypeScript, inspired by the [Evolu](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu) code style. It organizes business logic into distinct modules and packages, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and clear locality of behavior.

## Project Structure

- **apps/**: Application entry points (e.g., server)
- **modules/**: Domain modules (e.g., film, rental)
- **packages/**: Shared packages (e.g., schema-validator, type-safe-errors)

## Credits

- Inspired by [Evolu](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu) code style
- Uses code from [Evolu Common package](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu/tree/main/packages/common)
