 * ### Example
 *
 * ```ts
 * assert(true, "true is not true"); // no-op
 * assert(false, "true is not true"); // throws Error
 *
 * const length = buffer.getLength();
 * // We know length is logically non-negative, but TypeScript doesn't
 * assert(
 *   NonNegativeInt.is(length),
 *   "buffer length should be non-negative",
 * );
 * ```
